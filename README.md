# GettingAndCleaningData

1. Point default working directory of R to the folder containing samsung data.
2. Copy run_analysis.R to the same folder.
3. Execute source("run_analysis.R") - to add source code of the r file.
4. Tidy data set will be saved as result.txt to the working directory.
5. Please, load the resulting file to R to verify with read.table("result.txt") command. Seems like text editors are unable to show columns properly. At least for me...
